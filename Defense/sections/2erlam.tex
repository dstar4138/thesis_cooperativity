    System Behaviours:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Degree of Parallelism
                \item Consistency of Cooperation

    Logging \& Report Generation

    \inote{
        \item We first want to look at four types of system behaviour ranges:
            \begin{itemize}
            \item Parallelism: Gets back to Ring vs Cloud, Compare the two. 
            \item Consistency: Ring/Star=consistent, but if given a random choice.
            \item Longevity: Ratio of Communicating/Computing processes.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Longevity = Time spent reducing (low=communicator)
                    \item Interactivity, also takes into account user interaction.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Full vs Partial Cooperation: Multiple groups of Stars or Rings.
            \end{itemize}
        \item Definitely won't get to all behaviour tests that were in report, 
            but will focus on the key ones for each scheduler mechanic.
        \item Finally, quickly, go over the current report generation that 
            ErLam can perform.

        \item To test longevity we can just vary the length of time the processes
            chug for all tests.
        \item To test interactivity though, we need a way to simulate user 
            interaction.
        \item $UserInput$ captures hanging for a single event. We can compose 
            these: $<NEXT>$
        \item With our cloud of processes (also called chugmachine) for 
            simulating a program with consistent working processes and

        \item Previously (besides Interactivity), all systems were full system 
            cooperation.
        \item We can of course use Interactivity for our partial system 
            cooperativity tests, but we would instead like to see logical grouping.

    Things we could log:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Process Queue Size (per LPU)
        \item Quantity of Reductions/Yields/Preempts
        \item State of the Scheduler (waiting/running)
        \item Channel State (Blocked/Unblocked)
        \item \ldots
    \end{itemize}

    \inote{ % Notes are offset X+1 intentionally.
        \item Queue-Length: work-stealing mechanics and saturation ability.
        \item Tick-Action: Visualize the density of computation/communication.
        \item Sched-State: Useful for comparing stealing/process selection 
                  mechanics.
        \item Chan-State: Tracking interactivity, speed of unblock=attentive 
                  to cooperation. 
        \item Of course there are more, but we limited ourselves to the above 
                  for initial testing purposes.
