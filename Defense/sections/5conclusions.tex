\section{Conclusions \& Future Work}

\subsection{ErLam Toolkit}

\begin{slide}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Test Primitives proved to be a good abstraction for 
            Process behaviours.
        \item Log generation, lots of overhead, but good observations.
    \end{itemize}

    \inote{
        \item Overall pleased with simulator and achieved its goal.
        \item Future Work: 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Generate more test primitives. 
                \item Clean up log generation (reduce overhead).
                \item Process evaluation uses alpha-reduction 
                      (can be sped up substantially).
                \item Make schedulers more adjustable (different
                        spawn/yields/etc).
                \item More Channel implementations
            \end{itemize}
    }
\end{slide}

\subsection{Cooperativity as a Metric}

\begin{slide}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Possible to recognize and benefit from.
        \item More to explore:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Alternate Message-Passing Types (Asymmetric?)
                \item ....
            \end{itemize}
    
    \end{itemize}

\end{slide}

\subsection{Cooperative Schedulers}

\begin{slide}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf Longevity Batching:} -  
        \item {\bf Channel Pinning:} -  
        \item {\bf Queue Sorting:} Would benefit from merging with
            Channel Pinning scheduler to increase likelihood that
            sorting puts channel partners close. 
    \end{itemize}

        \item Merging Schedulers
